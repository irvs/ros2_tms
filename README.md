# ROS2-TMS

ROS2-TMS is an IoRT(Internet of Robotic Things) multi-platform in TMS(Town Management System), which is the development of a management system for an informationally structured environment (ISE). This is newly reconstructed in the middleware of system, ROS2. This system integrates various types of data gathered by distributed sensors, stores them to an on-line database, plans proper service tasks by a service robot, and executes planned robot motion.
