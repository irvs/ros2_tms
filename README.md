# ROS2-TMS

ROS2-TMS is an IoRT (Internet of Robotic Things) library for TMS (Town Management System), which is the management system of an informationally structured environment (ISE). ROS2-TMS is newly constructed on the basis of ROS-TMS and designed to adopt the robot middleware, ROS2. This system integrates various information gathered by distributed sensors, stores them to an on-line database, plans proper service tasks by service robots, and manages and executes planned robot motion.
