<!--
  This Behavior Tree does the bare minimum - it invokes ComputePathToPose to
  compute a path using the global planner. It then invokes the local planner
  (FollowPath) with this path. The path endpoints (input to the global planner)
  and the resulting path (output of the global planner and input to the local
  planner) are passed on the blackboard.
